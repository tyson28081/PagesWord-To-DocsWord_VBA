# PagesWord-To-DocsWord_VBA
With this ***VBA MACRO WORD*** Resource, we are going to convert each page of a Word to independent .DOCX documents. For example, if I have a Word Document with 7 pages, these 7 pages will be extracted separately as new Word Documents; I mean 7 Word documents apart from the original.
